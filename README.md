# Aerial Object Classification & Detection

## Project Description
This project focuses on detecting and classifying objects from aerial or drone images using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The system identifies objects such as vehicles, buildings, roads, and other structures from aerial views.

## Objectives
- Detect objects in aerial images
- Classify detected objects into multiple categories
- Improve accuracy using deep learning models

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Deep Learning (CNN)
- Object Detection Models (YOLO / SSD / Faster R-CNN)
- TensorFlow / PyTorch

## Applications
- Drone surveillance
- Traffic monitoring
- Urban planning
- Disaster management
